--- Launch the project ---
Run command:
- catkin_make
To compile it

Run command:
- roslaunch src/project1/launch/launcher.launch
To launch it


--- Add or Remove robots ---
Firstly, they have to be added to the launch.launch file like:
<node pkg="project1" type="moveRobot" name="moveRobot#ID#" output="screen">
	<param name="ID_ROBOT" value="#ID#"/>
	<param name="LEADER" value="#LEADER_CODE#"/>
	<param name="ALGOR" value="#ALGOR#"/>
</node>

where:
- #ID#: Is the number id of the robot that matches the map robot id
- #LEADER_CODE#: Is the number id of the robot which will be followed by this one, -1 means it goes to the map goal
- #ALGOR#: Stands for the algorithm the robot will use: 1 - Simple, 2 - Potencial

Secondly, they have to be added to the mundo_template.world file like:
pioneer2dx
(
  name "robot_#ID#"
  pose [ 0.000 -7.000 0.000 0.000 ]
  color "blue"
  sicklaser
  ( 
     # plug the ../examples/ctrl/lasernoise.cc module into this laser
     ctrl "lasernoise" 

   alwayson 1 # don't wait for a subscriber
  ) 
)

where:
- #ID#: Is the number id of the robot that matches the launch robot id

Finally, to remove robots you only have to delete their respective objects in launch.launch and world_template.world
