--- Launch the project ---
Run command:
- catkin_make
To compile it

Run command:
- roslaunch src/project1/launch/launcher.launch
To launch it


--- Create or modify a goal ---
To modify the goal you just need to modify its coordinates ("X_GOAL" and "Y_GOAL") on the launch folder and it will be auto-updated on the generated map:
  <node pkg="project1" type="talkerGoals" name="talkerGoals" output="screen">
    <param name="X_GOAL" value="8.0"/>
    <param name="Y_GOAL" value="6.0"/>
    <param name="T_GOAL" value="5.0"/>
  </node>


--- Add or Remove robots ---
To add or remove robots you just need to update the total number of robots from the "NUM_ROBOTS" parameter:
  <param name="NUM_ROBOTS" value="2"/>

You have to also add the starting positions of the robot in the map modifying its "X_START" and "Y_START" parameters:
  <node pkg="project1" type="moveRobot" name="moveRobot0" output="screen">
    <param name="ID_ROBOT" value="0"/>
    <param name="LEADER" value="-1"/>
    <param name="ALGOR" value="2"/>
    <param name="X_START" value="7.0"/>
    <param name="Y_START" value="-7.0"/>
  </node>
